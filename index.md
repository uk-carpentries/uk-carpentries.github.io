# UK Carpentry Community

The UK Carpentry Community is the welcoming and inclusive space for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) 
to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration, to get the communityâ€™s questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpentry workshop websites, 
registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry institutional membership or anything else to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers.

Join us share your experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.
